The only way you can cover up your bad breath would be to hold up your arms.
You kinda look like a wrench.
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.
Nee! Nee! Nee!
You're an empty-headed animal food trough whopper.
You slime eating dog, you scum-sucking pig, you son of a motherless goat!
Your mom dropped you off at school and got a fine for littering.
I'm sorry, but I don't engage in mental combat with the unarmed.
I'm not insulting you, I'm describing you.
Were did you get that shirt from? your grandpa it smells like it.
your hair smells like smelly feet.
I can't tell the diffrence between you and a blob fish.
Your head is the shape of a worn out office chair.
where did you find that shampoo? in the dumpster.
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Umm whats with the outfit it's horrific.
your singing is as bad as a goat scream.
I dislike everything you like.
you're the new and not improved stinky teachers pet.
are you a pig? I can't tell.
lift some weights you can't even lift two pounds.
your baking should be on front cover of nailed it.
you will always have text neck.
if you had a show, all the seats would be empty.
your jokes are sooo good i forgot to laugh.
your only friend is a crumb.
your hair is a perfect place for a fly to live.
you blind me.
you eat live bugs for breakfast.
your breath is a sewer.
